\chapter{Thesis Repository}
As part of this thesis, a dedicated repository has been created to store all source code, scripts, benchmarking results and other related files. The repository is publicly available at:

\begin{center}
\textbf{\url{https://github.com/multiib/beegfs-thesis}}
\end{center}

This repository includes the following components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Benchmarking Code:} Scripts used to measure throughput, latency, and other performance metrics for IPoPCIe, SuperSockets, and Ethernet.
    \item \textbf{Graph Plotting Scripts:} Python and LaTeX scripts for generating visual representations of benchmarking results.
    \item \textbf{Experimental Results:} Raw data collected from various test runs, formatted for reproducibility.
    \item \textbf{BeeGFS Modifications:} Any relevant code changes made to enable SuperSockets or adjust transport mechanisms.
\end{itemize}

This repository serves as a supplementary resource for this thesis, ensuring that all experiments can be replicated, validated, and extended in future research.
